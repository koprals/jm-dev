   * About:
   *    JAXL stands for "Just Another XMPP Library"
   *    For geeks, JAXL stands for "Jabber XMPP Library"
   *    
   *    I wrote this library while developing Gtalkbots (http://gtalkbots.com)
   *    I have highly customized it to work with Gtalk Servers and inspite of
   *    production level usage at Gtalkbots, I recommend still not to use this
   *    for any live project.
   *    
   *    Feel free to add me in Gtalk and drop an IM.
